# times_tools

Input generation tools for the TiMeS program

The central script is `setup_times.py`, which reads the Fock and
overlap matrices of the device region and automatically constructs
input matrices (onsite and nearest-neighbour) in TiMeS format and
a TIMES.inp configuration file.

The script can accommodate three possible structures:

 * different leads (default)
 * identical leads (option --identical-leads)
 * only leads; "wire" structure (option --leadsonly)
